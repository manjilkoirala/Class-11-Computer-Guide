            "Explain computer architecture with block diagram and function of its component.",
        img: "assets/computer.png",
        answer:
            "Computer architecture can be defined as a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, management and implementation of computers. Computer architecture is a functional descriptional of requrirements and design implementation for the various parts of computer.Computer Architecture comprises logical functions such as instruction sets, registers, data type and addressing modes.\n\nFunction of component of computer system are:\n1) Input Unit: It accepts the data or instructions given by the user and converts the data or instructions from man readable to machine code. Generally, it act as a interface/bridge or medium through which communication between user and computer takes place. In short following are the functions performed by the input unit:\n  1. It accepts the list of instruction and data from the outside world.\n  2. It converts the supplied instruction and data into computer acceptable form that is binary code.\n  3. It supplies the converted instruction and data to the computer system for further processing.\nSome common input devices are keyboard, mouse,etc.\n\n2) Central Processing Unit(CPU): Once the information is entered into the computer by the input device, the processor processes it. The CPU is called the brain of the computer because it is the control center of the computer. It first fetches instructions from memory and then interprets them so as to know what is to be done. If required, data is fetched from memory or input device. Thereafter CPU executes or performs the required computation and then either stores the output or displays on the output device. The CPU has three main components which are responsible for different functions: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU) and Memory Unit (MU).\n  1. ALU: ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. It is one of the most important  unit of processing. Where actual execution of the instruction takes place during processing. It performs arithmetic and logical operations and controls speed of those operations as directed by control unit(CU). To be clear all the calculation and decision are made in ALU. The data and instruction are stored in the primary memory before processing, and are transferred when needed to the ALU. ALU is designed to perform fundamental mathematical operations such addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and logical Operation which perform Comparison between the two or more than two operands to make a solid decision also known as logical operation which consists of logical OR, logical AND and logical NOT.\n  2. CU: The Control unit coordinates and controls the data flow in and out of CPU and also controls all the operations of ALU, memory registers and also input/output units. It is also responsible for carrying out all the instructions stored in the program. It decodes the fetched instruction, interprets it and sends control signals to input/output devices until the required operation is done properly by ALU and memory.\n  3. MU:  Memory unit is responsible for storing data and instruction either for short or longer period of time. Basically memory unit stores data and instruction before and after processing . As we know, memory are needed for program being currently used or to store data and instruction permanently . Depending upon the nature of data stored memory unit are distinguished into primary memory and secondary memory. Memory unit of CPU is a primary memory where data and instruction are stored temporarily. Where as  the processed data and information can be stored in secondary memory permanently so that user can retrieve information whenever required. There are two types of memory used in our computer system: Primary memory/Main memory and Secondary memory/Auxiliary Memory.\n\n3) Output Unit: It is the unit through which all the results are given out by output devices. It converts the binary data coming from CPU to human understandable form. The popular output devices are: printers, monitor, plotter, sound etc."),

        question: "Explain Primary Memory with its type.",
        answer:
            "Primary Memory is also known as main memory of computer. This is the place where our data and instruction are stored before processing and the result are stored before displaying output. Memory which stores data and information currently being used by the computer is known as primary memory.\nFeatures of primary memmory are:\ni. It is not used to store data permanently.\nii. It is usually volatile except ROM.\niii. It is usually expensive and faster than Secondary storage.\niv. It is normally used for smaller storage.\n\nThere are two type of Primary memory.\n1. RAM: RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It's called “random” because you can read store data randomly at any time and from any physical location. It is also known as volatile memory that means data and instruction written in RAM gets erased away when electric power is off. There are two types of RAM:\n SRAM: SRAM Stands for Static Random Access Memory.  It is made up of transistors. It is called static because it can remember its memory content without being refreshed or as long as there is power. SRAM doesn't need periodic refreshment. It is faster than DRAM but more consume more electricity.\n DRAM: DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is made up of capacitors. It is called dynamic because it needs periodic refreshment and can remember its memory content only after being refreshed as long as there is electric charge in a capacitor. It consume less electricity and is less expensive but is slower than SRAM.\n2. ROM: ROM Stands for Read Only Memory. It is also known as non-volatile memory as data and instruction remain even after there is no power supply. Data are stored in ROM during manufacturing time. The program present in ROM is called firmware and is responsible to boot the computer. There are mainly three types of ROM are:\n PROM: PROM Stands for Programmable read-only memory. PROM is a form of digital memory. In this type of ROM, each bit is locked by a fuse or anti-fuse. The data stored in it are permanently stored and can not be changed or erasable. It is used in low-level programs such as firmware or microcode.\n EPROM: EPROM stands for Erasable programmable read-only memory. EPROM also called EROM, is a type of PROM but it can be reprogrammed. The data stored in EPROM can be erased and reprogrammed again by ultraviolet light. Reprogrammed of it is limited.\n EEPROM: EEPROM stands for Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory. This type of chip can be erased and reprogrammed repeatedly with special electric pulses. It doesn't require special device to write onto it. EEPROM can be re-programmed without removing it from the computer. The duration of erasing and programming of the EEPROM is near about 4ms to 10ms."),

        question: "Define Operating System. Explain its function.",
        answer:
            "An Operating System is defined as a set of system programs that control and co-ordinate the over all operationsof computer system.It act as an interface between hardware and users. The major objective of operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system.\n\nFunctions of operating system are:\ni. Input/Output management: OS manages the input and output of computer. this applies to the flow of data among computers,terminals and other devices.\nii. Command interpreter: The command interpreter takes a command from the user and then os translates it into a detailed set of instructions, which computer can understand easily.\niii. Data Management: OS software also manages the stores and retraiecval of data.As the system software handle many of the details associated with the process , such details are not primary concern for users.\niv. File Management: File managment creates a mechanism of files and directories by making a table of each files and directories in the storage device. So as to keep track of each element.\nv. Memory Management: Memory is a large array of bytes, each with its own address. When the user request CPU for read-write operation. OS determines the amount of memory required for the program instruction and data. Then OS allocates required memory to load the program and  data into RAM. When the program terminates it freeze up the space and new program is loaded.\nvi. Process Management: A processor is a hardware device taht is capable of executing a sequence of intructions. The cpu of any computer system is called a processor. One of major task of OS modules is to manage and schedule the tasks effectively by the processor. The main activities of processor management are job queuing, job scheduling, keeping track of the status of each process,etc.\nvii. User Interface: A interface is a set of commands or menue through which a user communicates with a program. A command-driven interface is one in which you enetr commands whenever by using menu-driven, you can select command from various menu displayed on the screen.\nviii. Security: The operating system of a computer has a number of built-in tools  to protect against security threats such as viruses, unauthorized access, suspicious network activity etc. The basic security in a OS is to control access to your computer by setting users and password.\nix. Virtual Memory Management: OS is used for Virtual Memory Management.With this software it is possible to increase the capacity of main memory without actually increasing its size.\nx. Dead-Lock prevention: During processing a situation can arise in which a resources shared by two or more process cannot continue because the resources required by a process is held by other. This situation is known as dead lock. For eg. If process-1 allocates resources A and later required resources B and process-2 allocates resources B and later requires resources A. In this situation neither process-1 nor process-2 will be executed. Such situation is called deadlock. Operating system ensure prevention of deadlock by taking situation action by careful allocation of resources."),

            "There are many Operating systems.But we can divide them into different basic:\n- on the basis of processing\n- On the basic of mode of use\n- On the basic of user interface\n\nA. On the Basis of Processing:\n1) Multi-programming OS:\n             Multi-programming is used in multi-user environment. It is the technique in which multiple user program are executed simultaneously by single processor.  Multi-programming means when two or more than two program are provided to the CPU for processing or loaded in the internal storage of CPU at the same instant of time. From the loaded program once the portion of one program is executed and the portion of another program is executed and so on. Thus, multi-programming refers to concurrent execution of several program. The main purpose of multi-programming is to increase the utilization of computer and its resources. Different forms of multi-programming OS are multi-tasking, multi-processing and multi-user.\n2)  Multi-tasking OS:\n             Multi-tasking OS allows more than one program to run concurrently mainly in a single user system. These computer are capable of executing several tasks or program at the same time. For executing several task it can be single or multi-processing system. In some multi-tasking system one of the process is called fore-ground (active) other are called background (inactive). Multi-tasking OS increase the productivity of the user by executing many task simultaneously. Some of the most common example are MS-Windows, Linux, MAC OS etc.\n3) Multiprocessing OS:\n             Multi-processing system has more than one processor linked in a coordinated way. Multiprocessing OS supports running a program in more than one CPU. Generally, super server are especially designed to support multiple processor. UNIX is commonly used multi-processing OS. Multi-programming and multiprocessing are no the same concept. Multi-programming involves concurrent execution of two or more programs by a single CPU, whereas multi-processing involves two or more processor (CPU) for controlling the different activities or execution of many program simultaneously. Multi-processing concept is also known as parallel processing. It is more costly and complex technique the multi-programming which dramatically increase the program execution speed of computer.\n4) Time-Sharing OS:\n             Time sharing is a technique which enable many people located in various terminal to use a particular computer system at a same time. Processors time which is shared among multiple user simultaneously is termed as time sharing. Multiple jobs are executed by the CPU by switching between then, but the switches occurs so frequently that user can receive a immediate response.\n5) Batch processing OS:\n             Batch processing is a technique which requires grouping of similar jobs, which consists of program, data and system command. It is also known offline processing. This type of processing is suitable in program with large completion or involvement. For example, Payroll, Weather forecasting, Statistical analysis and many more. User need not wait while the job is being processed. They can submit their program to the operator and collect them later which means, the jobs are entered stored on a disk in a batch or queue and is executed one after another under the control of the OS.\n6) Multi-threading OS:\n             A program in execution is known as process and can be divide into multiple smaller sub process. This sub-process are known as thread. Multi-threading OS has the ability to divide process into threads and execute them concurrently. Threads are individual process that execute simultaneously in multi-tasking OS.\n7) Real time OS:\n             Real time processing method is one that controls environment by receiving data and taking action quickly to affect the functioning of the environment at the same instant of time. It is an online processing system in which processing time is critical. The entire processing task has to be completed in the predefined time.\n8) Online processing OS:\n             It is a popular processing technique at present. In this method transaction are processed as soon as it happen at the place of its origin. It is quite simple compare to real time OS. In this type, user can interact or provides input during processing as well. The output is provided back to the user as soon as processing is completed.\n\nOn the Basic of Mode of Use:\n1) Single User OS:\n             It is usable by single user at a time. It supports only one program at a time.There are used on general PC and otehr hand held devices. Example:MS-DOS, PC-DOS, etc\n2) Multi-User OS:\n             OS that allows multiple users to access a computer system concurrently is multiuser OS. When more than one user is processing data at a same time, using one CPU is called Multi-user sharing system. Example:Window,UNIX,LINUX"),

        question: "Define programming language. Explain its types.",
        answer:
            "A programming language is a computer language that is used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Python) to perform a specific task. Programming language are the set of different keywords, variables, operators, loops, and other entities using different character sets including numbers, special symbol and alphanumeric values.\n            The process of writing the programming language is known as programming and the person who writes program is programmers.\n          There are two types of programming language. They are:\n\n1) Low-level programming language: ow-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. Program written for one type of system cannot be run in another system in this language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.\n           Low-level language is further divided into two parts:\ni. Machine Language:\n                Machine language is a type of low-level programming language. It is also called as machine code or object code. This language consists a sequence of 0's and 1's to generate instruction. Since, it uses binary numbers, this type of language is directly understood by processor. So, it has higher execution speed.\n              Advantage of machine language are it is directly understood by the processor so execution speed is relatively high and Language translator is not required.\n              Disadvantage of machine language are difficult and time consuming to develop and debug program and program developed for one system cannot be operated in another system.\nii. Assembly Language:\n                Assembly language (ASM) is also a type of low-level programming language that is designed for specific processors. It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic and human-understandable form. It uses an assembler to convert the assembly language to machine language.\n              The advantage of assembly language is that it requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program.\n\n2) High-level programming language:\n                High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This language is close to English language. High level language code is written in English like structure using mathematical notation. Since it is similar to English language, it is easier to develop and debug the program. It is machine independent language (i.e. program developed for one processor can work on another processor). This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).\n                  The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.\n                  The main disadvantages of high-level language is that the program needs conversion before execution so, execution is slower compared to low level language.\n            A high-level language is further divided into three parts:\ni. Procedural oriented Language(3GL):\n            Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) language is derived from structured programming and based upon the procedure call concept. It divides a program into small procedures called routines or functions. Since it focuses only on procedure, it is complex and time consuming to write a large program. This type of language follows top to bottom approach i.e. main function is written at the bottom of the program. This type of language doesn't pose important and powerful feature like data encapsulation, data inheritance, data extraction and so on. So, this type of language has less security compared to object-oriented language. Examples: C, FORTAN, QBasic, etc.\nii. Object Oriented Language(4GL):\n            This is the advance form of high-level language which primarily focuses on data rather than procedure. It allows the user to specify what the output should be without describing all the detail (i.e. procedure) of how the data should be manipulated. This type of language follows bottom up approach. That means all main function are written at the bottom of the program whereas classes and object are described at top of the program. Since it has several powerful features such as data encapsulation, data extraction and inheritance, the data are more secure compared to procedure language. Examples: C#, C++, Java, etc.\niii. Natural language(5GL):\n            Natural language is a part of human languages such as English, Russian, German, and Japanese. It is used by machines to understand, manipulate, and interpret human's language. It is used by developers to perform tasks such as translation, automatic summarization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), relationship extraction, and topic segmentation. It is still in developing stage; computer scientists are working hard for developing such language. However, programming language like PROLOG (programming logic) is currently in use. For example: - instead of writing some unusual code, programmers would write: “who are the salesmen who has sold more than 30,000 products last month?”"),

        question: "Define language processor. Explain its types.",
        answer:
            "Language processor is also know as language translator. It is a type of softhware that is use to convert codes of high level or assembly level to machine language.  Since it is difficult and incontinent to write a program in machine level language, language developer uses several assemblies and high level language which are not directly understood by the computer. Hence, we use different types of language processor to convert and make machine understandable. There are different types of language translators. They are:\n\ni. Assembler: These language translator/processor converts program written in assembly level language (source program) into machine understandable language (object language) Since assembly level language are closer to machine level language, the conversion taken by assembler is relatively less. It converts program at once into machine level language.\n\n ii. Interpreter: This is the type of language which converts program written in high level language (source program) into machine level language (object program). It converts one statement at a time so its debugging can be easier and less time consuming. Its program execution is slower than that of compiler. Most of the new programming language use interpreter which allocate less memory space. Programs like BASIC, C#, Php, etc. use interpreter for conversion.\b\niii. Compiler: Those language processors which helps to convert program written in high level language (source program) into machine level program (object program). It converts whole program into machine level language at once. It is the largest method of translating a program in which debugging is complex and time consuming. Programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc. use complier."),

        question: "Define multimedia. Explain its components/elements.",
        answer:
            "Multimedia consist of two words 'Multi' and 'Media', Where multi means many and media means way/medium of expressing information. Hence, multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms. The information can be expressed in either text, audio, video, graphics and animation. We use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia any information can be illustrated in greater depth.\n\nComponents/Elements of multimedia are:\ni. Text: It is the collection of alpha numeric values or any characters. It can be a word, single line or a paragraph. We can create and customize text by using several text editor or word processor such as MS-Word, Notepad etc. It is the basic form or way of expressing information. By using multimedia software we can customize the text by giving several size, color, type, style etc. Extension of text documents are .docx, .txt etc.\nii. Graphics / Images: \"A picture is of thousand words\" which means picture can describe things more than a text. Graphics generally refers to image or pictures. The smallest element of picture is called Pixel (Picture Element). Hence the quality of image or picture is denoted by number of pixel available in that picture, Generally termed as resolution. We use several multimedia software such as Adobe Photo shop, Corel draw, Adobe indesign etc. Extension of images are .jpeg, .png etc.\niii. Audio: Audio is the one of the important components of multimedia. It gives the sensation of hearing. Audio can be used to enhance the understanding level in any particular topic. Audio can be human voice, instrument notes, natural sound, digitally synthesized sound and many more. In these days Audio can be transfer from one place to another by converting it into digital signal. FM radio use this component to express their information. Several multimedia software such as windows media player can be used to play audio. Extension of audio are .mp3, .wma etc.\niv. Video: The video is the running frames of static pictures that means video are generated by capturing maximum number of images in unit time. Frame per second [FPS] is the term widely used to describe the smoothness of a video. Generally there are 15-25 frame per seconds, to generate smooth movement in video.

        question: "Define information security. Explain various methods of it.",
        answer:
            "Information Security is not only about securing information from unauthorized access. Information Security is basically the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. Information can be physical or electronic one.\n                   information security refers to the process of protecting our network infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, modification, destruction or any malfunction. We can use several physical and software preventive measures to protect ourselves from such unethical activities. Information security helps to create a secure environment for computers, users and programs. Information Security programs are build around 3 objectives, commonly known as CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.\n            Various method of information security are:\ni. Access Control: This type of data security measures includes limiting both physical and digital access to critical systems and data. This includes making sure all computers and devices are protected with mandatory login entry, and that physical spaces can only be entered by authorized personnel.\nii. Authentication: Similar to access controls, authentication refers specifically to accurately identifying users before they have access to data. This usually includes things like passwords, PIN numbers, security tokens, swipe cards, or biometrics.\niii. Backups & Recovery: Good data security means you have a plan to securely access data in the event of system failure, disaster, data corruption, or breach. You’ll need a backup data copy, stored on a separate format such as a physical disk, local network, or cloud to recover if needed.\niv. Data Resiliency: Comprehensive data security means that your systems can endure or recover from failures. Building resiliency into your hardware and software means that events like power outages or natural disasters won't compromise security.\nv. Encryption: A computer algorithm transforms text characters into an unreadable format via encryption keys. Only authorized users with the proper corresponding keys can unlock and access the information. Everything from files and a database to email communications can — and should — be encrypted to some extent."),
