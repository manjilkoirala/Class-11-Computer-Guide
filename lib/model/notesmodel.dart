        question:
            "4. Explain computer architecture with block diagram and function of its component.",
        img: "assets/computer.png",
        answer:
            "Computer architecture can be defined as a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, management and implementation of computers. Computer architecture is a functional descriptional of requrirements and design implementation for the various parts of computer.Computer Architecture comprises logical functions such as instruction sets, registers, data type and addressing modes.\n\nFunction of component of computer system are:\n1) Input Unit: It accepts the data or instructions given by the user and converts the data or instructions from man readable to machine code. Generally, it act as a interface/bridge or medium through which communication between user and computer takes place. In short following are the functions performed by the input unit:\n  1. It accepts the list of instruction and data from the outside world.\n  2. It converts the supplied instruction and data into computer acceptable form that is binary code.\n  3. It supplies the converted instruction and data to the computer system for further processing.\nSome common input devices are keyboard, mouse,etc.\n\n2) Central Processing Unit(CPU): Once the information is entered into the computer by the input device, the processor processes it. The CPU is called the brain of the computer because it is the control center of the computer. It first fetches instructions from memory and then interprets them so as to know what is to be done. If required, data is fetched from memory or input device. Thereafter CPU executes or performs the required computation and then either stores the output or displays on the output device. The CPU has three main components which are responsible for different functions: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU) and Memory Unit (MU).\n  1. ALU: ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit. It is one of the most important  unit of processing. Where actual execution of the instruction takes place during processing. It performs arithmetic and logical operations and controls speed of those operations as directed by control unit(CU). To be clear all the calculation and decision are made in ALU. The data and instruction are stored in the primary memory before processing, and are transferred when needed to the ALU. ALU is designed to perform fundamental mathematical operations such addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and logical Operation which perform Comparison between the two or more than two operands to make a solid decision also known as logical operation which consists of logical OR, logical AND and logical NOT.\n  2. CU: The Control unit coordinates and controls the data flow in and out of CPU and also controls all the operations of ALU, memory registers and also input/output units. It is also responsible for carrying out all the instructions stored in the program. It decodes the fetched instruction, interprets it and sends control signals to input/output devices until the required operation is done properly by ALU and memory.\n  3. MU:  Memory unit is responsible for storing data and instruction either for short or longer period of time. Basically memory unit stores data and instruction before and after processing . As we know, memory are needed for program being currently used or to store data and instruction permanently . Depending upon the nature of data stored memory unit are distinguished into primary memory and secondary memory. Memory unit of CPU is a primary memory where data and instruction are stored temporarily. Where as  the processed data and information can be stored in secondary memory permanently so that user can retrieve information whenever required. There are two types of memory used in our computer system: Primary memory/Main memory and Secondary memory/Auxiliary Memory.\n\n3) Output Unit: It is the unit through which all the results are given out by output devices. It converts the binary data coming from CPU to human understandable form. The popular output devices are: printers, monitor, plotter, sound etc."),
    Notes(
        question: "5. Explain Primary Memory with its type.",
        answer:
            "Primary Memory is also known as main memory of computer. This is the place where our data and instruction are stored before processing and the result are stored before displaying output. Memory which stores data and information currently being used by the computer is known as primary memory.\nFeatures of primary memmory are:\ni. It is not used to store data permanently.\nii. It is usually volatile except ROM.\niii. It is usually expensive and faster than Secondary storage.\niv. It is normally used for smaller storage.\n\nThere are two type of Primary memory.\n1. RAM: RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It's called “random” because you can read store data randomly at any time and from any physical location. It is also known as volatile memory that means data and instruction written in RAM gets erased away when electric power is off. There are two types of RAM:\n SRAM: SRAM Stands for Static Random Access Memory.  It is made up of transistors. It is called static because it can remember its memory content without being refreshed or as long as there is power. SRAM doesn't need periodic refreshment. It is faster than DRAM but more consume more electricity.\n DRAM: DRAM stands for Dynamic Random Access Memory. It is made up of capacitors. It is called dynamic because it needs periodic refreshment and can remember its memory content only after being refreshed as long as there is electric charge in a capacitor. It consume less electricity and is less expensive but is slower than SRAM.\n2. ROM: ROM Stands for Read Only Memory. It is also known as non-volatile memory as data and instruction remain even after there is no power supply. Data are stored in ROM during manufacturing time. The program present in ROM is called firmware and is responsible to boot the computer. There are mainly three types of ROM are:\n PROM: PROM Stands for Programmable read-only memory. PROM is a form of digital memory. In this type of ROM, each bit is locked by a fuse or anti-fuse. The data stored in it are permanently stored and can not be changed or erasable. It is used in low-level programs such as firmware or microcode.\n EPROM: EPROM stands for Erasable programmable read-only memory. EPROM also called EROM, is a type of PROM but it can be reprogrammed. The data stored in EPROM can be erased and reprogrammed again by ultraviolet light. Reprogrammed of it is limited.\n EEPROM: EEPROM stands for Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory. This type of chip can be erased and reprogrammed repeatedly with special electric pulses. It doesn't require special device to write onto it. EEPROM can be re-programmed without removing it from the computer. The duration of erasing and programming of the EEPROM is near about 4ms to 10ms."),
